    You are given an image of a shopping receipt. Your task is to extract the following information:

    1. Shop name
    2. A list of purchased items, each with its name and price
    3. Total amount paid
    4. Any discounts labeled as "Lidl Plus Offer" â€” for each, return the associated item name and the discount amount

    Return the result in JSON format with the following structure:
    {
    "shop": "<shop name>",
    "items": [
        {"name": "<item name>", "price": "<price>"}
    ],
    "offers": [
        {"name": "<item name>", "discount": "<discount amount>"}
    ],
    "total": "<total amount>"
    }

    Notes:
    - Exclude headers, footers, and non-item lines unless they clearly relate to purchases or discounts.
    - Prices and discounts should be numeric strings (e.g., "0.99", "-0.25").
